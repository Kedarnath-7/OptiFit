## Features

- User profile management for storing personal information.
- Simulated data collection from wearables (steps, sleep hours) for multiple users.
- Generation of personalized health recommendations based on user profiles.
- Potential for real data integration from fitness wearables and IoT devices.
- Extensible machine learning models for health recommendations.

## Usage
1. User Profile Management:

  Create user profiles by instantiating the UserProfile class.
  Update user profiles with personal information, such as name, age, gender, weight, and height.
  
2. Data Collection from Wearables:

  Use the WearableDevice class to simulate data collection from wearables.
  Update user profiles in real-time with steps and sleep hours data.
  
3. Personalized Health Recommendations:

  Employ the HealthRecommendation class to generate personalized health recommendations based on user data.
  Recommendations may include dietary advice, exercise plans, and sleep guidelines.
  
4. Advanced Integration:

For real-world use, integrate the application with actual fitness wearables and IoT devices to gather accurate data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) - detailed in the project files.
- (Optional) Real fitness wearable devices for data integration.
